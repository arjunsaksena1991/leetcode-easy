Not sure why the answer is a bit weird for Q1 but this is my solution:

with comb_table as (
select sender_id, send_to_id, requester_id, accepter_id
from friend_request
left join request_accepted
on 
sender_id = requester_id and
send_to_id = accepter_id
group by sender_id, accepter_id
)
select round(coalesce(count(requester_id)/count(sender_id),0),2) as accept_rate
from comb_table

Also accepted since there is no correlation between dates:
select ifnull(round((count(distinct requester_id,accepter_id)/count(distinct sender_id,send_to_id)),2),0.00) as accept_rate
from friend_request, request_accepted
